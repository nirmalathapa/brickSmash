A simple brick smashing with a ball and a paddle made on HTML5, css and pure javascript from Mdn 2d canvas game tutorial. 
- You have ability to move padding with mouse and key moving left and right;
- There are 10 lives and you get score everytime when you hit the ball with the brick
I am practicing with the html5 2d games and it seems really amazing and fun. Also easy to follow tutorial from Mdn.
